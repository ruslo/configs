# Configuration file for the color ls utility.

# COLOR needs one of these arguments: 'tty' colorizes output to ttys,
# but not pipes. 'all' adds color characters to all output.
# 'none' shuts colorization off.
COLOR tty

# Extra command line options for ls go here.
# Basically these ones are:
#  -F = show '/' for dirs, '*' for executables, etc.
#  -T 0 = don't trust tab spacing when formatting ls output.
OPTIONS -F -T 0
